# Vehicle-Insurance-Prediction-Pipeline
End-to-end machine learning project for predicting vehicle insurance claims. This repository features a robust training pipeline, automated logging, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) on AWS, and deployment of a FastAPI-based web service for real-time inference. The project emphasizes modularity, scalability, and production-readiness.

## Creating and Distributing Your Python Package
After creating your setup.py file, you can generate a distributable package by running the following command:
```
python setup.py sdist
```
## Installing the Package Locally
To install the package locally, run the following command:
```
pip install path/to/package.tar.gz
```
Make sure to replace path/to/package.tar.gz with the actual path to the .tar.gz file.
## Sharing the Package
You can also share the .tar.gz file with others. They can install the package on their system using the following command:
```
pip install path/to/package.tar.gz
```
This allows easy distribution of your package without needing to upload it to a package index like PyPI.

Alternatively, the package can be uploaded to PyPI, allowing others to directly install it from there.
